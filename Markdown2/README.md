# Part 2 - Extend a library design

Now, form small groups of at least 3 people.
Each member of each group will now give their design to
another member of their group, such that everyone ends up with someone elses design.

> **Task**: Extend the design you were given to support TuTinyMark 2.0 (given in `./specification.md`).
> Change the documentation accordingly.

You should think about and answer (in some form) the following questions:
- How much of the original design did you have to change?
  - How big are the changes?
  - Did the original design foresee those changes?
- Which properties of the design made the change easier/harder?
